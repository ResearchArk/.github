## A world where scientific discovery thrives without administrative friction

Where AI amplifies human ingenuity, democratic collaboration accelerates breakthroughs, and every idea with merit finds the resources to create measurable impact.

---

## The Ark Ecosystem

Seven AI-native modules that transform how you discover funding, develop proposals, build partnerships, manage identity, accelerate discovery, orchestrate programs, and cultivate communities.

| Module | Tagline | Description |
|:------:|:--------|:------------|
| **ArkSearch** | AI-native Funding Discovery | Precision pathways to optimal funding. Discover research funding opportunities with AI-native search, advanced filtering, bio-based matching, and intelligent recommendations. |
| **ArkAssist** | AI-native Proposal Development | From concept to compelling proposals. Get intelligent support for grant applications, eligibility analysis, budget planning, and compliance checking. |
| **ArkSphere** | Open Innovation Partnerships | Building brilliant research teams. Open, inclusive platform connecting researchers, startups, SMEs, and innovators—enabling democratic consortium building and collaborative breakthroughs. |
| **ArkID** | Universal Research Identity | Unifying the research identity continuum. Universal identity and trust system with standardized identifiers (ARKI, ARKU, ARKP, ARKO, ARKD, ARKF) for researchers, institutions, and projects. |
| **ArkLab** | Ethical Autonomous Scientific Discovery | Amplifying human intellect through AI partnership. Researcher Workbench with Git-compatible version control, AI-native co-scientists, and Self-Driving Lab OS for autonomous experimentation. |
| **ArkNexus** | Vision to Impact Program Platform | Orchestrating innovation excellence from vision to impact. End-to-end RTDI program management covering strategic planning, call creation, evaluation, implementation, and impact assessment. |
